# Advent of codpilote ?

What is this repo ? Why is it here ? What is the goal of this ? What is the meaning of life ?

## Explanation
This repo will host my "advent of codpilote" serie. I will try to solve the exercices of the advent of code 2020 with the help of my friend [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). 

I'm quite busy this year so I don't have time to solve the advent of code daily. I will try to solve a few exercices every time I have some free time.

The only twist here is there's some rules :
- 1 : I am not allowed to write a single line of code by myself.
- 2 : I am not allowed to modify the code generated by Copilot.
- 3 : I am allowed to interract with every files in the folder (rename, delete, create, etc.).
- 4 : I must ask Copilot whichlanguage to use for each exercice and stick to it.
- 5 : I am allowed to change a line to another from Copilot.
- 6 : I am allowed to write debug lines only if theses lines are generated by Copilot. I can remove them whenever I want.

I will try to explain the process of solving the exercice and the way I use Copilot to help me.
Codes in this repo are the result of this experiment and have a lot of bad practices. I don't recommend using them in any way.

## Exercice 1
### Problem

The first exercice was about finding digits in every lines of a file and summing them. The instructions can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1).

### Chain of thought
I first asked Copilot which language to use as specified by the rules while rewording the problem in a way that would be easier for Copilot to understand.

Then, according to rule number 3, I created a python file and asked Copilot to solve the problem for me.

I had to rename the input file to `input.txt` as Copilot was looking for it but when I ran the code, it worked like a charm.

The complete code can be found [here](day-1/main.py).

### Part 2
The second part of the exercice was the same as the first one but digit could sometimes be written in full letters.

And god, Copilot was a bit lost on this one.

The first idea used by Copilot was to use a regex to find the digits in the file. It was a good idea but it was not working as expected. By checking if a patern was matching `(one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|zero\d)` it was not able to find digit when they were merged like "twone" (which is 21).

I then tried to make him used a loop but it's first idea was to use a single loop which only results in the same problem as before.

So I decided to make him use two loops, one looping over the char of the line and the other trying if every words made from the current char and the next `n` one was a digit. It was hard to explain to Copilot but it worked.

You can find below screenshots of me trying to explain to Copilot what I wanted him to do.

### Conclusion of day 1

This first exercice was not that hard except the second part that buged Copilot a lot but it was a good way to see how Copilot was working depending on the explanation and how I could use it to solve the advent of code.
